# `sequence` [![Build status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![NPM version][version-image]][version-url] [![Js Standard Style][standard-image]][standard-url]

This package exports a function similar to [Ramda's sequence](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#sequence) function.

Note that it is strictly curried (see demo usage below).

## Known issue

For this package to work, the `Applicative` (see below) ADT value you use must have the following sematics for the `.ap` method: `fnApplicative.ap(valueApplicative)`. This is [Fantasy Land pre-v1.0.0 semantics](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

[Folktale 2](https://github.com/origamitower/folktale)'s Applicative ADTs have this behaviour for their `.ap` method (and support v1.0.0+ semantics of `.ap` via `valueApplicative['fantasy-land/ap'](fnApplicative)`).

`sequence` uses the `.ap` method. This means `sequence` will work with Folktale 2 ADTs (as well as Folktale 1 mico-libs like [data.maybe](https://github.com/folktale/data.maybe) etcâ€¦).

In the future, it is likely that a major version update of this package will take a config Object as the first curried function which can configure which sematics of `.ap` to use. Apart from this, it will be possible to add to this config enabling/disabling of "basic type checking" to make sure we have the required methods that make up an "Applicative". This "basic type checking" is on by force in version `^1.0.0` - which could get expensive for large iterables.

## Install

`npm i @justinc/sequence`

### Demo

(See tests for more example usage). Also, there's a REPL file you can run with `node repl.js`.

```js
const Maybe = require('folktale/data/maybe')
const sequence = require('@justinc/sequence')

const { Just, Nothing } = Maybe

// "strictly curried" means you cannot use short-hands like `sequence(Maybe.of, [Just(1), Just(2), Just(3)])`.
// That's extra functionality provided by Ramda (not provided here).
sequence(Maybe.of)([Just(1), Just(2), Just(3)]) // ==> Just([1, 2, 3])
```
