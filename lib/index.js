 * The `applicativeReturningFn` is expected to return a value of type Applicative.

 * e.g. if `applicativeReturningFn` returns a Maybe, iterable is expected to have Maybe

 * > "Transforms a Traversable of Applicative into an Applicative of Traversable."
 *
 * e.g. if `applicativeReturningFn` returns a Maybe, and iterable is made up of Maybe
 * T values, then this function returns a `Maybe<Array<T>>` where T is a type like String etcâ€¦
